# react-native-calculator
A simple calculator built with React Native for Android.

# Development environment
You will need to setup the development environment for the React Native CLI. Please follow [this guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) from the React Native official documentation.

In short, React Native requires the following:
- Node (>=16)
- JDK11
- Android 13 (Tiramisu) SDK

# Run the project
First, you will need to clone this repository to a local directory. Then, `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies. Finally, run `npx react-native run-android`, this should start `Metro` and automatically open the Android emulator (provided that you setup the development environment correctly).
